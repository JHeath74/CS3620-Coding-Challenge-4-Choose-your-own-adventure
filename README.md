# CS3620-Coding-Challenge-4

Choose your own adventure game

Youâ€™ll use conditionals and branching to create a story. At each decision point, the user will enter a word.
The word will tell the program which path to continue following. Your program should handle all possible 
paths that the user might choose, and also handle any unexpected input from the user.
